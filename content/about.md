I’m a data analytics professional with deep experience in **wealth management operations, advanced analytics, and automation** within large-scale financial institutions.

Currently, I work as an **Assistant Vice President – Data Analytics at Citi**, where I design and lead analytics initiatives that sit at the intersection of **finance, compliance, operations, and technology**.

## How I think
I focus on:
- Translating complex data into **clear executive decisions**
- Designing **scalable, governed analytics frameworks**
- Applying AI/ML where it creates *real* operational value

## What differentiates me
- Proven ownership of **enterprise-scale initiatives**
- Strong balance of **technical depth + business context**
- Experience mentoring analysts and building analytics culture

I’m most excited by roles where analytics, automation, and financial decision-making come together to create long-term impact.
